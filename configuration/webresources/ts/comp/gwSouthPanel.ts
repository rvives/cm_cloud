/**
 * Guidewire's TypeScript APIs are an early-stage feature and are subject to change in a future release.
 *
 * The south panel (also known as the workspace) is displayed at the bottom of the UI and contains one or more
 * worksheets, which can contain arbitrary panels, inputs and so on. You can switch between worksheets via tabs at
 * the top of the workspace.
 *
 * The south panel is in one of three states:
 * - Hidden entirely
 * - Showing normally
 * - Minimized (just the worksheet tab labels showing)
 *
 * The server determines whether the south panel is hidden. On every render it will figure out the current worksheet,
 * if any, and then render it. The client side code cannot hide the south panel directly, it must cause a server
 * request that will then figure out if there is still a current worksheet and render accordingly. All tab changes
 * also require a server round trip and re-render, as the client only has the content for the "current" worksheet.
 *
 * The client is in control of the south panel height and whether it is minimized. These values are both kept in
 * local storage and the controls for resizing and minimizing the south panel are purely client side. So when the
 * panel is minimized all its contents is available on the client side, just not all visible.
 *
 * The very first time the south panel is displayed there will be no stored height or minimization flag and, in that
 * case, the client side code will set the south panel height to be a proportion of the overall UI height.
 *
 * Resizing the south panel is done via a drag control so it implements the GwDraggableSystem interface.
